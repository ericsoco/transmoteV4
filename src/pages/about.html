				With education and work experience in the fields of architecture and digital media, Eric Socolofsky has a versatile design sensibility that strongly influences his production as a developer, designer, and artist.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following an undergraduate education in architecture at Washington University in St. Louis, Eric practiced architecture in Chicago for three years.  His curiosity in digital and interactive media led him to NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program graduate school in New York.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since receiving his Master’s degree, Eric has experimented with a variety of work, including web, game, and user interface design and programming, interactive and generative screen-based art, and interactive spatial installations.  Following a fellowship in Eyebeam's Moving Image department, Eric designed and built the comic generation tool Quickcomic.com, led the development of Gamestar Mechanic with New York City-based GameLab, and taught at New York University and Pratt University.  He designed and built exhibits at San Francisco's Exploratorium, prior to his current position as a front-end engineer for Flickr.<br/>
